.SH NAME
timew-config \- Timewarrior configuration file an override options
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew rc.<name>=<value> <command>
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior stores its configuration in a file in the user's home directory:
~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg.
.
This file contains a mix of rules and configuration settings.
Note that the environment variable $TIMEWARRIORDB can be set to override this location.
.
The values 'true', '1', 'y', 'yes' and 'on' are all equivalent and enable a setting.
Any other value means disable the setting.
.
Default values may be overridden by timewarrior.cfg values, which may in turn be overridden on the command line using:
.
  rc.<name>=<value>
.
For example, to turn off verbose mode:
.
  rc.verbose=0
.
Note that hints can also do this (:quiet).
