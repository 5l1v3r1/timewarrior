timew-week \- display week chart

.TP
.B timew week [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
The week command shows a chart depicting a single week (current week by
default), with colored blocks drawn on a timeline. The chart summarizes the
tracked and untracked time.

Accepts date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

  $ timew week
  $ timew week monday - today

The 'reports.week.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The default date range shown is ':week'.

The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time.

For more details, and precise times, use the 'summary' report.

See also 'day', 'month', 'summary'.
