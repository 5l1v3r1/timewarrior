# Disclaimer during ongoing development

We want to discourage you from using the development version of Timewarrior.

The development branch is being actively updated and may not pass all quality
tests, therefore it may harm your data. In fact, as a new project, it doesn't
have adequate tests to prove that everything works. We do not guarantee proper
or even adequate functionality, performance or timely fixes.

We welcome bug reports from beta- and release-level software, but generally not
development versions. If you are undaunted by this, please:

- Make proper backups.
- Expect broken and missing functionality.
- Be aware that using the development branch involves risks.
- Give us lots of feedback, to improve the software.
