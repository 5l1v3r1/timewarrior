.SH NAME
timew \- A command line time tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew <command>

.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior is a command line time tracker. It allows you to very easily track
your time spent on projects, and generate summary reports.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

Timewarrior supports many commands.

.TP
.B timew
When run with no arguments, the default command is run, which indicates whether
there is any active tracking, and if so, shows a summary.

.TP
.B timew continue
Resumes tracking the most recently closed interval. For example:

  $ timew track yesterday 9am - 5pm tag1 tag2
  $ timew continue

The 'continue' command creates a new interval, starting now, and using the tags
'tag1' and 'tag2'. See also 'start', 'stop'.

.TP
.B timew diagnostics
This command shows details about your version of Timewarrior, platform, how it
was built, compiler features, configuration, file access, extensions and more.
The purpose of this command is to help diagnose configuration problems, and
provide supplemental information when reporting a problem. See also 'extensions'.

.TP
.B timew export
Exports all the tracked time in JSON format. See also 'import'.

.TP
.B timew extensions
Displays the directory containing the extension programs, and a table showing
each extention and its status. See also 'diagnostics'.

.TP
.B timew help [<command> | hints]
The help command shows detailed descriptions and examples of commands and the
supported hints. For example:

  $ timew help
  $ timew help start
  $ timew help hints

.TP
.B timew log [<message>]
Writes the info <message> to the Timewarrior log file. If <message> is ommitted,
writes a cut marker ('-------- 8< --------') line to the log file.

.TP
.B timew start [<tag> ...]
Begins tracking using the current time, and the specified optional set of tags.
If a tag contains multiple words, and therefore contains spaces, use quotes to
surround the whole tag. For example, this command specifies two tags ('weekend'
and 'Home & Garden'), the second of which requires quotes.

  $ timew start weekend 'Home & Garden'

Quotes are harmless if used every time. See also 'continue', 'stop', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew stop [<tag> ...]
Stops tracking time.  If tags are specified, then they are no longer tracked.
If no tags are specified, all tracking stops. For example:

  $ timew start tag1 tag2
  ...
  $ timew stop tag1

Initially time is tracked for both 'tag1' and 'tag2', then 'tag1' tracking is
stopped, leaving tag2 active. To stop all tracking:

  $ timew stop

See also 'continue', 'start', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew tags
Displays all the tags that have been used.

.SH HINTS
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that
start with a colon like this:

  :week

Hints serve several purposes. This example is a shortcut for the date range
that defines the current week. Other hints, such as:

  :quiet

Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all
forms of feedback, for purposes of automation. The supported hints are:

  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details

  :day           The 24-hours of the current day
  :week          This week
  :month         This month
  :quarter       This quarter
  :year          This year

  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
                 Only functions when exclusions are provided
