Use Cases
=========

Basic usage summary:

  $ timew start tag1                             # Start tracking now
  $ timew start "Home Improvement Project"       # Stop old interval, start new interval now
  $ timew stop                                   # Stop all tracking
  $ timew report month                           # Run report 'month'

If a time is specified, it always means today:

  $ timew track 8am - 10am tag1

If days are specified, they always mean the past:

  $ timew track mon - wed tag1

If today is thursday, the following covers the curent week because the previous
monday would be after the previous friday, therefore the friday refers to the
next friday, at EOW:

  $ timew track mon - fri tag1

If overlapping intervals are permitted (configuration: interval.overlap=yes),
then this creates overlapping intervals:

  1 $ timew start tag1
  ...
  2 $ timew start tag2
  ...
  3 $ timew stop tag1
  ...
  4 $ timew stop tag2

  With overlapping intervals:
    o-------o         tag1
       o--------o     tag2
    1--2----3---4---> time

Track time but backfill to the most recent interval end:

  $ timew track fill tag1

Record yesterday's time:

  $ timew track yesterday tag1

Defining Exclusions:

  $ timew define holidays eng-USA
  $ timew define holidays work 2015-11-26
  $ timew define workweek mon-fri
  $ timew define workday start 8:30am
  $ timew define workday end 1730
  $ timew define workday tue end 3pm

The above examples simply use ad-hoc tags, which is an undefined tag. They are
simply used as tags, and have no metadata. Defining a tag allows it to have
associated metadata:

  $ timew define tag "tag1"
  $ timew define tag "tag1" description "Description of tag1"
  $ timew define tag "tag1" start 2016-01-01
  $ timew define tag "tag1" end 2016-06-30
  $ timew define tag "tag1" budget 20 hours per week
  $ timew define tag "tag1" budget 400 hours total
  $ timew define tag "tag1" overlap

P: So the first six lines of examples show timew in use without any exclusions.  That just turns it into a stopwatch.
F: yes.
P: But when you add exclusions, you get to say “timew track monday tag1” and it does something less than 24 hours.
   You also get to use fill.
F: Right.


F: I like the rules for days.
   Referring to the past.
P: Yes, I think that makes sense.
F: Do we want to have “modifiers” for this?
P: How so?
F: timew track last week mon - wed tag1
   or
   timew track mon - wed last week tag1
P: Yes, we do, but I would prefer this:
   timew track last week monday - last week wednesday tag1
F: Yes.
P: Maybe we’ll find a better way to do this, but we need to be able to do all kinds of weird things with dates:
   last monday, this monday, next monday, monday
F: Would this here ever happen?
   timew track last week tag1
P: yes
   That’s an auto-fill if you have exclusions.
F: tag1 = vacation on the island
