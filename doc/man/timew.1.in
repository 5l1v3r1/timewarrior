.SH NAME
timew \- A command line time tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew <command>

.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior is a command line time tracker. It allows you to very easily track
your time spent on projects, and generate summary reports.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

Timewarrior supports many commands.

.TP
.B timew
.br
When run with no arguments, the default command is run, which indicates whether
there is any active tracking, and if so, shows a summary, and exits with a code
0. If there is no active time tracking, exit code is 1.

.TP
.B timew cancel
If there is an open interval, closes and abandons it.
See also 'stop'.

.TP
.B timew continue
Resumes tracking the most recently closed interval. For example:

  $ timew track yesterday 9am - 5pm tag1 tag2
  $ timew continue

The 'continue' command creates a new interval, starting now, and using the
tags 'tag1' and 'tag2'. See also 'start', 'stop'.

.TP
.B timew diagnostics
This command shows details about your version of Timewarrior, platform, how it
was built, compiler features, configuration, file access, extensions and more.
The purpose of this command is to help diagnose configuration problems, and
provide supplemental information when reporting a problem. See also 'extensions'.

.TP
.B timew export [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Exports all the tracked time in JSON format. See also 'import'.

.TP
.B timew extensions
Displays the directory containing the extension programs, and a table showing
each extention and its status. See also 'diagnostics'.

.TP
.B timew help [<command> | hints]
The help command shows detailed descriptions and examples of commands and the
supported hints. For example:

  $ timew help
  $ timew help start
  $ timew help hints

.TP
.B timew [report] <report> [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands
are equivalent:

  $ timew report foo :week
  $ timew        foo :week

This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.

.TP
.B timew start [<date>] [<tag> ...]
Begins tracking using the current time, and the specified optional set of tags.
If a tag contains multiple words, and therefore contains spaces, use quotes to
surround the whole tag. For example, this command specifies two tags ('weekend'
and 'Home & Garden'), the second of which requires quotes.

  $ timew start weekend 'Home & Garden'

An optional date may be specified to indicate the intended start of the tracked
time:

  $ timew start 8am weekend 'Home & Garden'

Quotes are harmless if used unnecessarily. See also 'continue', 'stop', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew stop [<tag> ...]
Stops tracking time.  If tags are specified, then they are no longer tracked.
If no tags are specified, all tracking stops. For example:

  $ timew start tag1 tag2
  ...
  $ timew stop tag1

Initially time is tracked for both 'tag1' and 'tag2', then 'tag1' tracking is
stopped, leaving tag2 active. To stop all tracking:

  $ timew stop

See also 'cancel', 'continue', 'start', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew tags
Displays all the tags that have been used.

.TP
.B timew track <interval> [<tag> ...]
The track command is used to add tracked time in the past. Perhaps you forgot
to record time, or are just filling in old entries.

.SH INTERVAL
An interval defines a block of time that is tracked. The syntax for specifying
an interval is flexible, and may be one of:

  [from] <date>
  [from] <date> to/- <date>
  [from] <date> for <duration>
  <duration> before/after <date>
  <duration> ago
  [for] <duration>

Examples are:

  from 9:00
  from 9am - 11am
  from 9:00:00 to 11:00
  from 9:00 for 2h
  2h after 9am
  2h before 11:00
  2h ago
  for 2h

.SH HINTS
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that
start with a colon like this:

  :week

Hints serve several purposes. This example is a shortcut for the date range
that defines the current week. Other hints, such as:

  :quiet

Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all
forms of feedback, for purposes of automation. The supported hints are:

  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details
  :yes           Overrides confirmation by answering 'yes' to the questions

  :color         Force color on, even if not connected to a TTY
  :nocolor       Force color off, even if connected to a TTY

  :yesterday     The 24 hours of the previous day
  :day           The 24 hours of the current day
  :week          This week
  :month         This month
  :quarter       This quarter
  :year          This year
  :lastweek      Last week

  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
                 Only functions when exclusions are provided

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
Timewarrior stores its configuration in a file in the user's home directory:
~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg.

This file contains a mix of rules and configuration settings.

The values 'true', '1', 'y', 'yes' and 'on' are all equivalent and enable a
setting.  Any other value means disable the setting.

.TP
.B confirmation = yes
Determines whether harmful operations require interactive confirmation.
May be overridden by the ':yes' hint.
Default value is 'yes'.

.TP
.B debug = off
Determines whether diagnostic debugging information is shown.
Useful for troubleshooting, but not for general use.
Default value is 'off'.

.TP
.B report.day.24hours = off
.br
Determines whether the day report shows all 24 hours in a day, or is limited
to only hours where data is tracked.  Default value is 'off'.

.TP
.B report.day.spacing = 1
.br
Specifies how many spaces are inserted between the hours in the day report
exclusions.  A value of '0' give a move compact report. Default value is '1'.

.TP
.B report.day.style = compact
.br
The 'compact' style puts the hour markers inside the exclusion blocks.

.TP
.B verbose = yes
Determines whether Timewarrior generates feedbac.
May be overridden by the ':quiet' hint.
Default value is 'yes'.
