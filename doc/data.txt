Data Files
==========
Intervals of tracked time are stored in a text file, with one line of text
representing one day. Here is a single tracked interval:

  YYYY-MM-DD <start>-<end> <tagset>

Here is an open-ended, currently tracked active interval, notice the missing
<end> timestamp:

  YYYY-MM-DD <start>- <tagset>

A typical day might look like this:

  2015-12-10 480-720 Upgrade Planning, 780- Upgrade Presentation "ABCD Inc"

The "480-720" is a time range, in this case from 8:00am to 12:00pm, associated
with the two tags "Upgrade" and "Planning". A second interval started at 1:00pm
and is incomplete, associated with three tags "Upgrade", "Presentation" and
"ABCD Inc". A tag must be quoted, if it contains whitespace.
