Timewarrior Color Themes
========================

The theme files define colors that Timewarrior uses in various situations.
There are several themes provided with Timewarrior, and you use a theme by
importing it into your configuration file. Edit this file:

  ~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg

And add the import line, which looks like this:

  import /path/to/theme/dark.theme

Create Your Own
---------------

It is easy to create your own Timewarrior color theme. The simplest approach is
to copy an existing theme and then modify the colors.

The individual color settings are all used by Taskwarrior, and providing a
color for each of these is best. If not color is provided for a setting, then
no color is used, a default does not apply.

The color palette is used to automatically color tagged time in reports. When
creating a color theme, the palette should be larger rather than smaller. It is
recommended that you provide at least 16 colors, otherwise Timewarrior cycles
through them and you'll see repetitions.


Share Your Theme
----------------

Having created a color theme, share it in the spirit of Open Source. Make it
available for download, or alternatively send it to us at:

  support@taskwarrior.org

We will list (and attribute) your theme on the Timewarrior support pages, where
you will find other themes and extensions.
