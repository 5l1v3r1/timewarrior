Reporting
=========
Some basic requirements:

- Reports should have multiple output formats: TTY, JSON, HTML.
- There will be a few different types of reports:
  - Tabular Calendar
  - List with subtotals, total
- Reports will be decorated, for example, subtotals, legend, title
- It should be possible to extend Timewarrior to add custom reports, via a
  simple hook mechanism.

P: Reports:  We need some built-in reports:
   $ timew report day
   $ timew report day monday
   $ timew report week
   $ timew report month
   $ timew report week +tag1 -tag2    <— has tag1, missing tag2, for creating client-specific reports
P: But we can’t anticipate all reports, and don’t have the manpower to implement them, therefore we need report extensions.  Something like hooks for tw.
F: what would these create anyway? basic output format - some columns on the screen? how formatted?
   I assume most people would want to feed the numbers into something else.
P: Yeah, not sure.  Some kind of list, tabular, with subtotals.
   Agree about what people might want.
   But we could do this:

   $ timew report week :tty                 (default)
   $ timew report week :json
   $ timew report week :html

   They would support tags for filtering.
F: good.
P: But yes, most people will want custom, I expect. The number of reports would grow over time I think.
