Timewarrior Extensions
======================

debug.py
  This is a debug extension that simply echoes back everything it sees in its
  input. It's handy to see how the command line affects what an extension sees
  and will likely be removed before release.

on-modify.timewarrior
  This is a Taskwarrior hook script that will integrate Timewarrior.
