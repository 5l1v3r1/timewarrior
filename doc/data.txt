Timewarrior Data
================
Timewarrior has a conceptual timeline, which is a continuum onto which the
inclusions and exclusions are mapped.

An inclusion is a block of time with associated tags, i.e. data captured or
provided by the user representing ongoing work.

An exclusion is also a block of time but represents untrackable time, and acts
as a mask for the inclusions. Here is a visual example:

  Inclusion:           [---------------     ---------------) tag1
  Exclusion:                           [---) lunch
  Exclusion                                                    [---) dinner

  Timeline:      ..:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...
                   7   8   9   10  11  12  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
                   am                  pm

In the example, there is one incluѕion, a block of time from 8am - 5pm, tagged
with 'tag1'. That was data captured from the command line, perhaps with this
command:

  $ timew track 8am - 5pm tag1

There are several ways to track time that result in the same inclusion, for
example, if these commands were run at 8am and 5pm respectively:

  [at 8am] $ timew start tag1
  [at 5pm] $ timew stop


Exclusions
----------
Exclusions are stored only as configuration.


Inclusions
----------
Inclusions are captured from the command line in many different ways, but all
results in an incluѕion record being written to the data file.

If there is an open-ended inclusion at the time an exclusion is changed, then
the open-ended inclusion is closed, and a new open-ended inclusion is added.
Starting a new inclusion closes existing inclusions.


Data Files
==========
The data file is a text file, which grows in length. It contains a set of
inclusion records.

An example file looks like this:

  inc 20160228T080000Z - 20160228T120000Z # Upgrade Planning
  inc 20160228T130000Z                    # Upgrade Presentation "ABCD Inc"

Blank lines are ignored. The first inclusion represents a four hour block of
time with two tags 'Upgrade' and 'Planning'. The second inclusion is open ended,
having only a start time (1pm UTC), but three tags 'Upgrade', 'Presentation'
and 'ABCD Inc'. The third tag is a quoted string because of the embedded space.

An open-ended inclusion like this means that the tracking continues, but the
exclusions prevent an excess time buildup of the 62½ hours that comprise the
weekend (Friday 5:30pm until Monday 8:00am).


Data File Names
---------------
The data file names will have the year and month numbers, which keeps the data
files small and therefore quicker to manipulate, eliminating the need for any
sophisticated archiving. For example:

  ~/.timewarrior/data/2016-02.data
  ~/.timewarrior/data/2016-03.data

To archive old data, simply move any subset of files out of this directory.


Long Inclusions
---------------
If an inclusion spans multiple data files, it is broken into adjacent inclusions
for each data file. For example, with an empty database, an inclusion of:

  inc 20160101T000000Z - 20160415T000000Z # tag1

Will be broken into separate inclusions, each in a separate file:

  2016-01.data: inc 20160101T000000Z - 20160131T000000Z # tag1
  2016-02.data: inc 20160201T000000Z - 20160229T000000Z # tag1
  2016-03.data: inc 20160301T000000Z - 20160331T000000Z # tag1
  2016-04.data: inc 20160401T000000Z - 20160415T000000Z # tag1

If the database is not empty, then checks for overlapping tags may prevent the
above records being written.


Undo Data
---------
The undo stack will be stored as:

  ~/.timewarrior/undo.data
