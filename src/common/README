Common
======

The 'common' library is a set of reusable objects to be shared as-is between
various programs, including Taskwarrior, Taskserver, Tasksh and Timewarrior.

In order to be reusable, and therefore a member of libcommon, rules must be
followed:

  - Common objects may only make use of other common objects, or external
    dependencies (libuuid, gettext, readline etc), but no objects from the
    parent directories.

  - Common objects can assume only an external 'cmake.h' that defines
    platform/portability constants.
