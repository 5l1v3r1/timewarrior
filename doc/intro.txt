Introduction
============
Timewarrior is a time tracking application, which allows you to record your
time spent on activities. At its simplest, you tell it to start and stop
tracking time:

  $ timew start
  ...
  $ timew stop

This will record a block of time as active, between the two timestamps that
were recorded when the 'start' and 'stop' commands were run.

By using tags, you can label the blocks of active time:

  $ timew start Home Cleaning
  ...
  $ timew stop

This tags the block of time with the two tags 'Home' and 'Cleaning'. The tags
allow you to identify how you spent that time, and is used by the reporting
system to summarize time.

You cna also record time retroactively. If you forgot to start recording this
morning, you can do this:

  $ timew start 8:30am Home Cleaning

Or if you forgot a whole activity:

  $ timew track 8:00am - 8:30am Exercise
  $ timew start 8:30am Home Cleaning

More sophisticated use is possible if you have defined your work week:

  $ timew define workweek mon-fri
  $ timew define workday start 8:30am
  $ timew define workday end 1730
  
  $ timew track yesterday Home Painting

Once the work week is recorded, vague terms like 'yesterday' can be resolved
into actual start/stop timestamps. If you define holidays, then it knows not to
track time on those days:

  $ timew define holidays eng-USA

Furthermore, Timewarrior can fill in gaps. For example:

  $ timew track last tuesday :fill Reasearch

There is a :backfill and :fill hint that tells Timewarrior how to fill the time,
for example:

  $ timew track yesetrday 8am - 10am Meeting
  $ timew track yesterday 3pm - 17:00:00 Training
  $ timew track yesterday 2pm ProjectA :backfill
  $ timew track yesterday ProjectB :fill

And the 'ProjectB' tagged interval will range from 2pm - 3pm.

Tags can have their own metadata, for example you can make a tag valid for a
given time range:

  $ timew define tag ProjectA end 2016-06-30
  $ timew define tag ProjectA budget 400 hours total

This is managed by a rules system that can impose constraints.

To see the currently active interval:

  $ timew

Reporting tracked time can be done with a simple report:

  $ timew report today
  $ timew report week Home
  $ timew report summary last week

  (sample output not available)

Or the data can be exported in JSON:

  $ timew export last month > February.json
