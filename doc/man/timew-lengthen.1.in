The 'lengthen' command is used to defer the end date of a closed interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to lengthen. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to lengthen:

  $ timew lengthen @2 10mins

Note that you can lengthen multiple intervals,:

  $ timew lengthen @2 @10 @23 1hour
