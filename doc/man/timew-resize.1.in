.TP
.B timew resize @<id> [@<id> ...] <duration>
The 'resize' command is used to change the duration of a closed interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to resize. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@3' as the interval you wish to resize:

  $ timew resize @3 15mins

Note that you can resize multiple intervals,:

  $ timew resize @3 @1 @13 1hour

See also 'summary', 'tag', 'untag', 'lengthen', 'shorten'.
