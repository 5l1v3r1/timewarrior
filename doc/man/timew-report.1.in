.TP
.B timew [report] <report> [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands
are equivalent:

  $ timew report foo :week
  $ timew        foo :week

This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.
