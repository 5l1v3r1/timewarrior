Reporting
=========
As we cannot anticipate all reporting needs, custom reports are necessary.
Rather than copy the Taskwarrior design where a report is a combination of a
filter, sort, columns and labels, a more flexible approach could encourage
shared custom reports.

Іf all reports are extension scripts/programs, utilizing some form of API,
then there is no restriction on the kind of report generated, which would
allow for HTML reports, rather than simply supporting tabular text.


Requirements
------------
Timewarrior should ship with several reports, which serve as example extensions
for users to evolve‥

Timewarrior should handle the command line options for reports, then pass off
a standardized set of parameters to the report extension. These parameters will
include:

- Date range. Although Timewarrior might support "last month" as a reporting
  range, the extensions themselves would be passed precise values, therefore
  reducing the complexity of the extensions.

- Data will be filtered by Timewarrior, so that extensions do not need to
  implement this.


Report Mockups
--------------
Purely as an example of what might be implemented, here are some report mockups:

TBD (calendar like "task calendar" with table below)

TBD (large weekly calendar, 5 days, every half-hour)

TBD (timeline, l-r)

TBD (table with subtotals)


Example Commands
----------------
Here are some provisional examples of report commands:

  $ timew report day [monday] [±<tag> ...]
  $ timew report week [±<tag> ...]
  $ timew report month

---

- Taskwarrior Hook script needs to allow 'project' (default) or an arbitrary
  UDA for time categorization.

- Need a JSON --> CSV converter, for spreadsheet folks.
