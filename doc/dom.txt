DOM - Document Object Model
===========================
Timewarrior needs DOM support, so that it can service a 'get' command and
provide data access to rules. Bothare important for extensions.


Data to be Accessed
-------------------
Here are the data accessible via DOM references:

- Configuration
- Exclusions
- Command line args in raw form (for rules, not 'get')


Syntax
------
All DOM references have this form:

  dom.<name>


--- Raw Notes ---

- Possible DOM references to support:

  dom.active                      --> 0/1                 Boolean indicator that tracking is active
  dom.active.tags                 --> 2                   Active tag count
  dom.active.tag.1                --> 'tag'               Active 1st tag
  dom.active.start                --> YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ    Active start time
  dom.active.duration             --> PT1H25M8S           Active elapsed

  dom.tracked.year                --> 231                 Quantity this year
  dom.tracked.quarter             --> 64                  Quantity this quarter
  dom.tracked.month               --> 21                  Quantity this month
  dom.tracked.week                --> 6                   Quantity this week
  dom.tracked.today               --> 2                   Quantity today
  dom.tracked.today.1             --> {...}               1st interval today JSON
  dom.tracked.today.1.start       --> YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ    1st interval today start
  dom.tracked.today.1.end         --> YYYYMMDDTÃžHMMSSZ    1st interval today end
  dom.tracked.today.1.tags        --> 1                   1st interval today tag count
  dom.tracked.today.1.tag.1       --> 'tag1'              1st interval today tag
  dom.tracked.today.1.duration    --> P1H25M8S            1st interval today duration

  dom.gap.today
  ...

- The above needs to support overlapping tags.

- The above needs to support totals.
