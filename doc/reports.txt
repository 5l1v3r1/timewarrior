Reporting
=========
Anticipating all reporting needs is impossible, therefore custom reports are
required. Rather than copy the Taskwarrior design where a report is a
combination of a filter, sort, columns and labels, a more flexible approach
could encourage shared custom reports, and use a more complete API.

Іf all reports are extension scripts/programs, utilizing an API, then there is
no restriction on the kind of report generated, which would allow for HTML
reports, rather than simply supporting tabular text.


Requirements
------------
Timewarrior will ship with several reports, which serve as example extensions
for users to modify and improve.

Timewarrior will handle the command line options for reports, then pass off a
standardized set of parameters to the report extension. These parameters will
include:

- Date range. Although Timewarrior might support "last month" as a reporting
  range, the extensions themselves would be passed precise values, therefore
  reducing the complexity of the extensions.

- Data will be filtered by Timewarrior, so that extensions will not need to
  reimplement this.

- Reports will be sized according to need, not according to available terminal
  width. If a report does not fit in a window, it is not an error.

There will be a default report, which is configurable so that one of the reports
or commands can be the default.


Report Mockups
--------------
Purely as an example of what might be implemented, here are some report mockups:

  ./report.week.txt
  ./report.day.1.txt
  ./report.exc.week.txt

  TBD (calendar like "task calendar" with table below)
  TBD (timeline, l-r)
  TBD (table with subtotals)


Example Commands
----------------
Here are some provisional examples of report commands:

  $ timew report day [monday] [±<tag> ...]
  $ timew report week [±<tag> ...]
  $ timew report month|quarter|year


Report API
----------
The report API is simple - it invokes a program and feeds it input. All output
is generated by the program. When running this command:

  $ timew report x ...

Timewarrior then runs this:

  $ ~/.timewarrior/extensions/x.*

With standard input consisting of:

  filter: ...
  name1: value1

  [
  { ... },
  { ... },
  ...
  ]

That is, the input is line-oriented, with first a header block of name/value
pairs, then a blank line, then the JSON filtered data. The header block has all
configuration names flattened, i.e. no hierarchy.


--- Raw Notes ---

- The Taskwarrior hook script should use a set of attributes for time tracking
  tags. Those will include: UUID, project, tags, description, and any chosen UDAs.

- Need a JSON --> CSV converter, for spreadsheet folks.

- Use display granularity/resolution to see more or less details.  This would
  combine nicely with a tag hierarchy. (Tomas Babej)

- Need reports to help users doing fixed-rate work - finding the longest task
  for example.

- If an interval has more than one tag with a defined color, and is being
  rendered, then use the first tag color. It doesn't really matter which.
