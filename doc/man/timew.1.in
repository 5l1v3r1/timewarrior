.SH INTERVAL
An interval defines a block of time that is tracked.
The syntax for specifying an interval is flexible, and may be one of:
.
  [from] <date>
  [from] <date> to/- <date>
  [from] <date> for <duration>
  <duration> before/after <date>
  <duration> ago
  [for] <duration>
.br
Examples are:
.
  from 9:00
  from 9am - 11am
  from 9:00:00 to 11:00
  from 9:00 for 2h
  2h after 9am
  2h before 11:00
  2h ago
  for 2h
.br
An interval is said to be 'closed' if there is both a start and end, and 'open' if there is no end date.
.
.SH HINTS
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that start with a colon like this:
.
  :week
.br
Hints serve several purposes.
This example is a shortcut for the date range that defines the current week.
.br
Other hints, such as:
.
  :quiet
.br
Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all forms of feedback, for purposes of automation.
.br
The supported hints are:
.
  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details
  :yes           Overrides confirmation by answering 'yes' to the questions
.
  :color         Force color on, even if not connected to a TTY
  :nocolor       Force color off, even if connected to a TTY
  :blank         Leaves tracked time out of a report
  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
  :adjust        Automatically correct overlaps
  :ids           Displays interval ID numbers in the summary report
.br
Range hints provide convenient shortcuts to date ranges:
.
  :yesterday     The 24 hours of the previous day
  :day           The 24 hours of the current day
  :week          This week
  :month         This month
  :quarter       This quarter
  :year          This year
  :lastweek      Last week
  :lastmonth     Last month
  :lastquarter   Last quarter
  :lastyear      Last year
  :monday        Previous monday
  :tuesday       Previous tuesday
  :wednesday     Previous wednesday
  :thursday      Previous thursday
  :friday        Previous friday
  :saturday      Previous saturday
  :sunday        Previous sunday
