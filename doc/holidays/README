Timewarrior Holiday Files
=========================

The holiday files were created using http://holidata.net data by the 'refresh'
script. This data can be updated using these commands:

  $ ./refresh

If you need another locale (for example xx-XX), do this:

  $ touch holidays.xx-XX
  $ ./refresh

If the locale is not supported by holidata.net, you will see an error.
