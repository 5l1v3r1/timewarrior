Data Files
==========
Intervals of tracked time are stored in a text file, with one line of text
representing one day. Here is a single tracked interval:

  YYYY-MM-DD <start>-<end> <tagset>

Here is an open-ended, currently tracked active interval, notice the missing
<end> timestamp:

  YYYY-MM-DD <start>- <tagset>

A typical day might look like this:

  2015-12-10 480-720 Upgrade Planning, 780- Upgrade Presentation "ABCD Inc"

The "480-720" is a time range, in this case from 8:00am to 12:00pm, associated
with the two tags "Upgrade" and "Planning". A second interval started at 1:00pm
and is incomplete, associated with three tags "Upgrade", "Presentation" and
"ABCD Inc". A tag must be quoted, if it contains whitespace.

---

P: Instead of one day per line, one interval per line:

   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM-                 tag1 tag2
   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM-YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM tag3

   The first has no 'end' timestamp, and is therefore an open track, ie active
   now. The second is a bounded range.


F: have an archive file as well?(edited)
P: I was thinking that we could auto-archive, moving out records older than X into another file.  Queries would then know in advance whether it needed to read the archive.


F: Should there be a possibility to freeze entries?
P: hmm.  Good point, I tihnk yes.
   For old data?  Or so that a workweek redefine has no effect?
F: the first yes. the latter, hm. perhaps. would make sense to get the reports correct that depend on that.

   --> If old data is frozen, what does that mean?  It should mean that the inclusions and exclusions are collapsed, and the net inclusions recorded and frozen. This prevents changes to the work week from modifying old information.
