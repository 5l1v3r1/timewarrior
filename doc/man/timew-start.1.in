.SH NAME
timew-start \- start time tracking

.TP
.B timew start [<date>] [<tag> ...]
Begins tracking using the current time with any specified set of tags.
If a tag contains multiple words, therefore containing spaces, use quotes to
surround the whole tag. For example, this command specifies two tags ('weekend'
and 'Home & Garden'), the second of which requires quotes.

  $ timew start weekend 'Home & Garden'

An optional date may be specified to indicate the intended start of the tracked
time:

  $ timew start 8am weekend 'Home & Garden'

If there is a previous open interval, it will be closed at the given start time.

Quotes are harmless if used unnecessarily. See also 'continue', 'stop', 'track'.
